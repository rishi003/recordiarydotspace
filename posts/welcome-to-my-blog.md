This is Rishabh Awatani born, in a small town called Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, India who later shifted to Ahmedabad, Gujarat and now lives in Dubai, UAE with many dreams in his eyes and a taste for technology.

Unlike many friends of mine who are pursuing their masters I took the road less trodden, by shifting to Dubai to get a job and start earning for my family. This desire was also fuelled by the philosophy of learning by doing which I strongly live by.

When I arrived in Dubai for the first time I was amazed and got almost absorbed by the dazzling life-style here but the bubble did not take much time to burst and soon I was grounded with the reality, a blank canvas in my hands which I had to fill with goals, objective and most importantly, a job.

So I began the hunting for a job a week after arriving which to my surprise didn't go well as **no one** wants to **hire** a **fresh graduate** and the blunt reality struck me like a hammer on the nail's head. The market here is competitive and there are at least 10 other applicants for the same job who have better chances of having prior experience; almost always greater than 7/10. Which when considered along with the scarcity of job openings, is quite scary.

Somehow I managed to get a job at an ITSM software reseller company as a Pre-sales Consultant, a position I never knew existed. My role as described on the paper is to communicate and understand the technical requirements of the clients and suggest them which of our product is best suited for their needs, and how. To my surprise my role was not limited to just that, I also began working on developing integration services to seamlessly integrate our product with third party software and services; mostly using Java but also time to time shuffling between a couple of web-frameworks and a number of database dialects.

Before accepting my role I didn't have a clue about how these enterprise systems are developed, packaged and maintained but as time passed and struggles increased, I kept on learning about everything I got my hands on and started dealing with actual run time problems which a system faces while working outside of the comfortable and protected development zone used to develop them.

Days in the beginning were tough and I felt lost as **I was the only person who knew how to code**, which is not a good thing as it was creating this invisible barrier between me and my colleagues as I couldn't ask for help to anyone and they thought that I am some magician who does weird things in his lab throughout the day.

The fact that I was the only one in the office who was working on development in parallel and had no one to share my work with for review and mentorship further added to my frustration. Although I knew that this is what the road less travelled would be like, it made times difficult.

The only thing that I felt I needed to do was stay focused and remember my purpose so that's what I did. I stopped worrying and kept on learning, became more engrossed in my work and spent more time researching about new technologies and thus had some of my own moments of success in which I could say to my self proudly:

> I never knew I could pull it off.

This website is just one of the many struggles which I somehow managed.
