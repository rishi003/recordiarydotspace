### Checklists:

Nothing works better than a checklist when it comes to dividing a huge task into smaller chunks which in turn help you to focus on one thing at a time. If you want to be a successful developer, this is a must have skill and I can promise you that it can transform any kind of complex activity into a manageable and  less overwhelming task.

There is no hard and fast rule to create one but if you like, you can follow some of the guidelines below:

- **Try to think of a problem in bits and pieces: ** Its better when you can identify a problem as a collection of individual activities which work in an orchestrated manner like an orchestra.
- **Write each task without going into it's details: ** No task description should be longer than a line as the sole purpose of this activity is to increase efficiency.
- **If it needs to be, divide a task into sub-tasks:**  If an individual task turns out to be complex, feel free to divide it into sub-tasks. *Never make your checklists deeper than 2-3 layers of tasks and sub-tasks.*
-  **Select a section and try to complete the tasks listed in it:**  You are good to go now, select a section and start working on one task at a time.

You will be astound by the effect it has on your brain and thought process as the activity is now divided into individual easy to-do list items.

#### FAQs

*Will it work in a project where tasks turn out to be deeply interdependent?* 

> You can be assured that this will not only let you concentrate on an individual task but also help you juggle between them efficiently as you can keep track of your activities with little note taking.

*Is it necessary for it to be written?*

> I am always in the favour of writing a task down rather than using an electronic way of recording a task as it gives me an opportunity to reflect on what I will be looking forward to and it increase the chances of remembering leading to form a bigger picture.

*How is it better than bug/requirement tracking system?*

> I will not say that it is a substitute of a successful bug/requirement tracking system but it is something that will aid in the process of planning. It is scientifically proven that information is organized in a better way when you write it down; there is a connection between your hands and your brain. It will thus create an understanding of the task or project, which is invaluable.
