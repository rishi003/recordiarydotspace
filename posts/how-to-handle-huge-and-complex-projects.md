### Checklists:

Nothing works better than a checklist when it comes to dividing a huge task into smaller pieces and focusing on one thing at a time. If you want to be a successful developer, this is a must have skill and I can promise you it can transform any kind of complex activity into a group of small manageable and  less overwhelming tasks.

There is no hard and fast rule to create one but if you like, you can follow some of the guidelines below:

- **Try to think of a problem in bits and pieces: ** Its better when you can identify a problem as a collection of individual activities which work in an orchestrated manner like an orchestra.
- **Write each task without going into it's details: ** No task description should be longer than a line as the sole purpose of this activity is to increase efficiency.
- **If it needs to be, divide a task into sub-tasks:**  If an individual task turns out to be complex, feel free to divide it into sub-tasks. *Never make your checklists deeper than 2-3 layers of tasks and sub-tasks.*
-  **Select a section and try to complete the tasks listed in it:**  You are good to go now, select a section and start working on one task at a time.

You will be astound by the effect it has on your brain and thought process as the activity is now divided into individual easy to-do list items.

#### FAQ

*Will it work in a project where tasks turn out to be deeply interdependent?* 

> You can rest assured that this will not only let you concentrate on an individual task but also help you in juggle between them effectively as you can keep track of your activities with little note taking.

*Is it necessary for it to be written?*

> I am always in favour of written over electronic way of recording a task as it also gives me an opportunity to reflect over what I will be looking forward to as well as increase the chances of remembering it to form a bigger picture.

*How is it better than bug/requirement tracking system?*

> I will not say that it is a substitute of a successful bug/requirement tracking system but it is something that will aid in the process of planning. It is scientifically proven that information is organized in a better way when you write it down; there is a connection between your hands and your brain. It thus creates an understanding of the task or project which is invaluable.
