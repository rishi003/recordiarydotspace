As opposed to the posts I have created before which were not rich at all this one is going to be something different.

![This is an image with alt](https://i.ibb.co/txjTzqW/humming-Bird.jpg)

Thus we have an image in the markdown with a title that also has a title to be used as an alt attribute in the html.

- Images can have an alt attribute making it accessible and SEO friendly.
- I can also create a bullet list which is quite impressive.

A markdown provides many formatting options which a re not only limited to **bold text for emphasis** and ability to use _italic text for subtle impact_ but also capability to insert a blockquote

> Like this is a blockquote.

## Not only that but these features are also there:

#### An ordered list:

1. like this is item one.
2. This is item two.

#### A Code Snippet

```java
public static void main(String args[]){
    System.out.println("Hello world");
}
```
